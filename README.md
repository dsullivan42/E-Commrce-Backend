# E-Commrce-Backend

on this project, I was given the starter code, and I needed to build the back end for this e-commerce website. I first, checked the index.js, then went through the models. I defined each of the columns for the code given, and I read through the index.js in the models folder to ensure that everything was properly connected (there's probably a better word to use). I then began working on my routes, first asynchronously, because that's how most of the homework went over it. Then I was met with some errors, so I changed everything to interract synchronously, however I was still met with some errors.  

I resolved these issues in code, and also realized I forgot to run my seed, which resolved my issue of not being able to get the data.



I asked a friend, how I would be able to change the code from asynchronous code, to synchronous code for the routes, and he explained it to me.
